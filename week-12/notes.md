Subject: Request for Change in Project Technology Stack

Respected Mam!
              I hope you are doing well.I'm writing to kindly request your approval to change the technology stack for the project Miss Rose Make-up Store.
After considering the project requirements and my current skill set, i would like to propose the following changes:

Back-End: Ruby on Rails
Database: PostgreSQL
 
I'm currently learning Ruby On Rails and have gained some foundational knowledge in it.I believe that using Ruby on Rails, along with PostgreSQL, would allow me to work more effectively.
    I would appreciate your feedback and guidance on this proposed change.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

Best reguards,
Abdul Qadeer
